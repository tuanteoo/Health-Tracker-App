## Health Tracker

The Health Tracker project is designed to help users monitor their health parameters and predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning. The application integrates a Random Forest model built in Python and provides a REST API for prediction results.

### Features

1. **Health Parameter Tracking:**
   - Users can input and track various health parameters, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, etc.
   - The application stores this data securely.

2. **Machine Learning Model:**
   - The Random Forest model, trained on historical health data, predicts the risk of heart disease based on the user's health parameters.
   - The model is integrated into the Java application.

3. **REST API:**
   - The application exposes a RESTful API to receive user data and return heart disease risk predictions.
   - Users can make API requests to get personalized risk assessments.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Java and Python on your local machine.
   - Set up a virtual environment for Python.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone your Health Tracker repository from GitHub.

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Build the Java application.
   - Start the server.
   - Ensure the Python environment with the Random Forest model is accessible.

4. **API Usage:**
   - Make POST requests to the API endpoint with user health data.
   - Receive heart disease risk predictions.
